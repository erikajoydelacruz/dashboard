# Web Application Dashboard (Treehouse Techdegree)

A dashboard is a user interface that provides an at-a-glance view of key performance indicators relevant to a business process.

This dashboard was created for an imaginary client looking for a way to track KPIs. There is a bar, line, and circle chart, along with sections to track multimedia post interactions and member interactions.

I used [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to create the bar, line, and circle charts, along with [CSS Toggle Switch](https://github.com/ghinda/css-toggle-switch) to create the toggle switches in the settings panel. These technologies were a project requirement, which taught me how to implement open source code in my own projects.

Throughout my whole Techdegree journey, this project was the toughest for me. I was out with a cold for about a week, and I had a rough time creating the responsive layout for this project. I should have set a fix width for desktop views so that containers will resize responsively. Some of the sections didn't match the mockup precisely such as the green notification dot and the notification bell. I also did not include the "exceeds expectations" requirements such as adding a local storage and dropdown notifications. By the time I finished the "expectations" requirements, I had been working on the project for about a month already and wanted to finish it as soon as possible. 

The goal of this project was to use different JavaScript components to create an interactive dashboard that has a simple UI for the client to use. If I could do this project again, I would use a different technique to create the flexbox layout. But overall, I think I did well in recreating the mockup provided for all screen sizes.
